# Performance Report

## Overview

This project aims to develop a business intelligence solution for a hospitality group, allowing them to gain insights into their financial performance and make data-driven decisions. The solution will be built using Microsoft Power BI, using data extracted from the company's existing ERP system and hotel management software.

## Objectives
- Develop a business intelligence solution that allows the company to monitor their financial performance and make data-driven decisions.
- Enable the company to identify areas of their business that require improvement and leverage trends and patterns in their data for more accurate decisions and planning.
- Provide insights into key financial indicators.

## Definition
The project will involve the creation of a data model by extracting and importing data from the company's ERP system and hotel management software into Microsoft Power BI. The data will be modeled, including the creation of the following matrices:

- `Balanço Patrimonial` (Balance Sheet) 
- `Demonstração de Resultados` (Income Statement) 
- `Rendimentos` (Revenue) 
- `Gastos com pessoal` (Personnel expenses) 

The matrices will define the corresponding accounts for each item in the structure.

Measures will be created, including the more complex `balanço` and `demonstração_resultados`, that will allow these financial statements to be presented in interactive visualizations.

An interactive report will then be developed using advanced data analytics and visualization techniques.

## Conclusion
This project is expected to provide significant benefits to the company in terms of their  performance monitoring and decision-making capabilities. The development of a business intelligence solution enables the company to gain insights into key indicators, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions.
